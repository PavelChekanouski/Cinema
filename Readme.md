The project was created to handle the PostgreSQL database. Here is the SQL script, which creates the database necessary for the task. There are 2 tables, director and film. The script also fills the database with test data. You can find postgresql driver to use JDBC in the resources directory. Application works with console, so read all recommindations in the app. This app needs some information such as url of using database. For me it is jdbc:postgresql://127.0.0.1:5432/Cinema. Also username of your account in postgresql(I used postgres) and password. Write all commands correctly. Ð¡ontact the hr for any problem. Good Luck.
